The derivation method for array and mapping matches the storage layout used by\n the solidity language / compiler.\n See https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays[Solidity docs for mappings and dynamic arrays.].\n Example usage:\n ```solidity\n contract Example {\n     // Add the library methods\n     using StorageSlot for bytes32;\n     using SlotDerivation for bytes32;\n     // Declare a namespace\n     string private constant _NAMESPACE = \"<namespace>\"; // eg. OpenZeppelin.Slot\n     function setValueInNamespace(uint256 key, address newValue) internal {\n         _NAMESPACE.erc7201Slot().deriveMapping(key).getAddressSlot().value = newValue;\n     }\n     function getValueInNamespace(uint256 key) internal view returns (address) {\n         return _NAMESPACE.erc7201Slot().deriveMapping(key).getAddressSlot().value;\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: Consider using this library along with {StorageSlot}.\n NOTE: This library provides a way to manipulate storage locations in a non-standard way. Tooling for checking\n upgrade safety will ignore the slots accessed through this library.\n _Available since v5.1._"},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":2758,"linearizedBaseContracts":[2758],"name":"SlotDerivation","nameLocation":"1607:14:11","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"body":{"id":2640,"nodeType":"Block","src":"1790:194:11","statements":[{"AST":{"nodeType":"YulBlock","src":"1825:153:11","statements":[{"expression":{"arguments":[{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1846:4:11","type":"","value":"0x00"},{"arguments":[{"arguments":[{"arguments":[{"name":"namespace","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1870:9:11"},{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1881:4:11","type":"","value":"0x20"}],"functionName":{"name":"add","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1866:3:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1866:20:11"},{"arguments":[{"name":"namespace","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1894:9:11"}],"functionName":{"name":"mload","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1888:5:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1888:16:11"}],"functionName":{"name":"keccak256","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1856:9:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1856:49:11"},{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1907:1:11","type":"","value":"1"}],"functionName":{"name":"sub","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1852:3:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1852:57:11"}],"functionName":{"name":"mstore","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1839:6:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1839:71:11"},"nodeType":"YulExpressionStatement","src":"1839:71:11"},{"nodeType":"YulAssignment","src":"1923:45:11","value":{"arguments":[{"arguments":[{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1945:4:11","type":"","value":"0x00"},{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1951:4:11","type":"","value":"0x20"}],"functionName":{"name":"keccak256","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1935:9:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1935:21:11"},{"arguments":[{"kind":"number","nodeType":"YulLiteral","src":"1962:4:11","type":"","value":"0xff"}],"functionName":{"name":"not","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1958:3:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1958:9:11"}],"functionName":{"name":"and","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1931:3:11"},"nodeType":"YulFunctionCall","src":"1931:37:11"},"variableNames":[{"name":"slot","nodeType":"YulIdentifier","src":"1923:4:11"}]}]},"evmVersion":"paris","externalReferences":[{"declaration":2634,"isOffset":false,"isSlot":false,"src":"1870:9:11","valueSize":1},{"declaration":2634,"isOffset":false,"isSlot":false,"src":"1894:9:11","valueSize":1},{"declaration":2637,"isOffset":false,"isSlot":false,"src":"1923:4:11","valueSize":1}],"flags":["memory-safe"],"id":2639,"nodeType":"InlineAssembly","src":"1800:178:11"}]},"documentation":{"id":2632,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"1628:74:11","text":"

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.
